Multiplexing
============

This project shows how to display 2 digit numbers on common cathode 7 segment  displays with a PIC16F877A.
Variable `Deco` store the hexadecimal code for each number to display (explained in num_codes.jpg file). 
In it's first position `Deco [0]` the hex code 0x3f is equivalent to number 0. Then, the second 
position `Deco [1]` is equivalent to the number 1 and so on.
